## ⭐ Business Problem 
MindEase is a digital wellness app helping users manage stress, sleep better, and build healthier screen-time habits. They are releasing a new feature: “Digital Balance Coach” , a personalized tool that recommends screen-time goals, break reminders, and sleep hygiene guidance based on user behavior.  
The product team does NOT know which user groups are most at risk, or what behaviors predict poor mental health outcomes.Without this clarity, they cannot design personalized interventions or decide which features matter most.  

<br>

## ⭐ Business Task
As the Data Analyst, your task is to analyze user behavior patterns to:
* identify high-risk user segments
* uncover behavioral factors linked to poor mental health outcomes
* how to personalize recommendations

<br>

## ⭐ Business Questions
1. Which behaviors (screen-time, sleep quality, addiction score) are most correlated with poor mental well-being?
2. Which user segments (age, gender, usage levels) show the highest risk of stress or low mood?
3. At what screen-time threshold do we see significant declines in mental well-being?
4. What patterns predict poor sleep or high stress?
5. What product recommendations can reduce mental health risks for each segment?

<br>

## ⭐ Tools  
* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* EDA & Statistical Exploration
