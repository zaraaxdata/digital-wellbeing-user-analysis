## Background
Mental-health apps and digital wellness platforms struggle to understand which user behaviors most influence emotional well-being. Users spend hours on social media, often without realizing how their digital habits impact stress, sleep, and happiness.
## Business Problem
This project analyzes how screen time, sleep quality, and lifestyle habits impact stress and happiness. The goal is to help mental-health apps design data-driven features that improve user well-being.
## Business Questions
1. Which digital & lifestyle habits most strongly drive stress levels?
2. Which factors have the largest positive or negative effect on happiness?
3. Do screen-time breaks or reduced social media use improve well-being?
4. Which user groups are at highest risk of poor mental health?
5. Which habits should a mental-health app focus on to improve user well-being?
